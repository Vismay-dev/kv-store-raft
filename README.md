Scalable and fault-tolerant distributed key-value store implementing the Raft consensus protocol for strong consistency. Based on the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](http://nil.lcs.mit.edu/6.824/2020/papers/raft-extended.pdf) extended paper by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.

**Key Points:**

- Fault tolerance is achieved via state-machine replication.
- Strong consistency is guaranteed by the Raft protocol (implemented from scratch).
- GETS can be served from any server node. PUTS/APPENDS can only be served by leader nodes.
- High performance is achieved via sharding and replica groups. (🚧)
- Support for AWS S3 storage for enterprise-grade durability and scalability. (🚧)

### Integration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant KVStore Service
    participant Raft Module
    participant RaftPeer Service
    participant Other Nodes

    Client->>KVStore Service: Put/Delete Request
    KVStore Service->>Raft Module: Is Leader?
    alt Is Leader
        Raft Module-->>KVStore Service: Yes
        KVStore Service->>Raft Module: Propose Log Entry
        Raft Module->>RaftPeer Service: AppendEntries RPC
        RaftPeer Service->>Other Nodes: Replicate Log
        Other Nodes-->>RaftPeer Service: Acknowledge
        RaftPeer Service-->>Raft Module: Log Committed
        Raft Module->>KVStore Service: Apply Command
        KVStore Service-->>Client: Operation Result
    else Not Leader
        Raft Module-->>KVStore Service: No
        KVStore Service-->>Client: Redirect to Leader
    end

    Client->>KVStore Service: Get Request
    KVStore Service->>KVStore Service: Read Local State
    KVStore Service-->>Client: Value
```

### Test Command

To run tests, use the following command:

```sh
make test
```
